# econ_club_r_example
This is the document form of the example I ran through a an Economics Club meeting at GVSU in Winter 2021. It provides students to have an example of what's possible in R and some additional commentary I believe is helpful.

This has been available on the club website for some time now. It recently occured to me this should be on my github as well. :smile:
